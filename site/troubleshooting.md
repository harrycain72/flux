Also see the [issues labeled with
`FAQ`](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/labels/FAQ), which often
explain workarounds.

### Flux is taking a long time to apply manifests when it syncs

If you notice that Flux takes tens of seconds or minutes to get
through each sync, while you can apply the same manifests very quickly
by hand, you may be running into this issue:
https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/1422

Briefly, the problem is that mounting a volume into `$HOME/.kube`
effectively disables `kubectl`'s caching, which makes it much much
slower. You may have used such a volume mount to override
`$HOME/.kube/config`, possibly unknowingly -- the Helm chart did this
for you, prior to
[weaveworks/flux#1435](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1435).

The remedy is to mount the override to some other place in the
filesystem, and use the environment entry `KUBECONFIG` to point
`kubectl` at it. This is what the Helm chart now does, so fixing it
may be as easy as reapplying the chart if that's what you're using.

This is also documented in the
[FAQ](./faq.md#can-i-change-the-namespace-flux-puts-things-in-by-default).

### `fluxctl` returns a 500 Internal Server Error

This usually indicates there's a bug in the flux daemon somewhere -- in which case please [tell us about it](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/new)!

### Flux answers everything with `git repo is not configured`

This means Flux can't read from and write to the git repo. Check that

 - ... you've supplied a git repo URL. If it's of the form
   `https://github.com/user/repo` then you will need to use the
   SSH-style URL, `git@github.com:user/repo` instead.

 - ... the deploy key has read/write access to the repo. In
   GitHub, deploy keys are installed in the settings for a
   repository. To get the deploy key Flux is using, use `fluxctl
   identity`.

 - ... that the host where your git repo lives is in
   `~/.ssh/known_hosts` in the fluxd container. We prime the container
   _image_ with host keys for `github.com`, `gitlab.com` and
   `bitbucket.org`, but if you're using your own git server, you'll
   need to add its host key. See
   [./standalone-setup.md](./standalone-setup.md#using-a-private-git-host).

### "The request failed authentication"

If you're using [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works/), this
probably means you haven't supplied the token. You can get the token
from the settings in Weave Cloud; set the environment variable
`FLUX_TOKEN` to the token.

If you have set Flux up standalone (as in the instructions in
[./get-started.md](./get-started.md)), this
probably means Flux is defaulting to using Weave Cloud because you've
not set the environment variable `FLUX_URL` to point at the
daemon. See [./standalone-setup.md](./standalone-setup.md).

### I'm using GCR/GKE and I keep seeing "Quota exceeded" in logs

GCP (in general) has quite conservative API rate limiting, and Flux's
default settings can bump API usage over the limits. See
[weaveworks/flux#1016](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/1016)
for advice.
